%RESAMPLE_FLOW   Resample flow field
%   OUT = RESAMPLE_FLOW(IN, FACTOR[, METHOD]) resamples (resizes) the flow
%   field IN using a factor of FACTOR.  The optional argument METHOD
%   specifies the interpolation method ('bilinear' (default) or
%   'bicubic'). 
%  
%   This is a private member function of the class 'clg_2d_optical_flow'.
